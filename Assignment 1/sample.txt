New York City is poised to ban the sale of large-size sodas and other sugary beverages 
in an effort to combat rising obesity rates, a city official said Thursday.
The ban would outlaw the sale of such drinks larger than sixteen ounces from restaurants, 
food carts and any other establishment that receives a letter grade for food service. 
It would not apply to grocery stores.  The New York City Board of Health will vote on 
the measure in June, the official said.
